Bookmarklets

The bookmarklets in this repo are not minified or URL encoded for use as a bookmarklet (I've kept them in standard format for easy reading and editing). Use an bookmarklet creator tool like http://bookmarklets.org to minify and URL Encode the scripts. Bookmarketmaker.org can even include JQuery for you.
